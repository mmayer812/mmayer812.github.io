						<h3>What is Therapy?</h3>
						<p>
							Therapy (or counseling) is a process where an individual, couple, or family meets with a therapist to discuss and better understand obstacles and emotions in oneâ€™s life. Often we work to understand the challenges we face in order to bring change to our lives. Through psychotherapy, together we can work to learn from your past, understand how it affects your present, and find a path that will make for a better future.
						</p>
						<p>
							Therapy provides a private, safe space to learn more about ourselves. Once we have a better sense of our own thoughts and feelings, we can work together to build skills for coping, managing, and creating change your life.Overall, counseling provides the opportunity for personal growth with the support and collaboration that is necessary for change.
						</p>
						<p>
							Collaboration is key. I believe the therapist and client are equals, and that you are the expert in your own life. You bring the knowledge that you have of yourself, and I will be there to provide non-judgmental support and an attentive ear to help give new perspective.
						</p>
