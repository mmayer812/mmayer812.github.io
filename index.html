									<p>
										My name is Madison Mayer, and I am a psychotherapy intern at Madison Mental Health Services in Madison, Wisconsin. I am currently enrolled in my final year as an advanced graduate student at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. I have a continuing passion for psychotherapy and social work.
									</p>
									<p>
										I enjoy working with a wide variety of people. I do have an interest in issues of mild to moderate severity because my hope is that meeting with a counselor will soon be as common as a visit to the dentist. We all have issues or personal crises at some point in our lives, and I believe that no one should have to take these journeys alone.
									</p>
									<p>
										Because of this personal interest, I work collaboratively with clients to help you gain a better sense of who you are, what you want, and where you want to go. Many people can relate to being unsure of any of these things, and if you or anyone you know is interested in help with these questions, I invite you to contact me.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before you contact me, feel free to browse my site to get a better sense of who I am – including my education, experience, and other information that may be helpful to you.
